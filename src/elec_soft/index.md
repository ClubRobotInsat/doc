# Electronique Logicielle

## How to start
1. Read guides in `STM32CubeIDE` section to :
- Install STM32CubeIDE
- Create a new project

2. Then clone the `stmlib` repository from the [Club Robot's GitHub](https://github.com/ClubRobotInsat/stmlib).

3. Read guides in stmlib section to :
- Add the library to your project
- Use the library

Now, start with something simple like blinking the onboard LED then an external LED.

For that, read the `STM32CubeIDE` section to know how to configure the peripheral, build the project and more!

## Understand how it work
Documentation for each module is available in the `stm32` sections. It will be added progressively (promise!).


## Resources
[STM32G4 reference manual](https://www.st.com/resource/en/reference_manual/rm0440-stm32g4-series-advanced-armbased-32bit-mcus-stmicroelectronics.pdf) : The Bible for ElecSoft's members, contain all you need to know about the STM32G4 peripherals.

[STM32G4 user manual](https://www.st.com/resource/en/user_manual/um2397-stm32g4-nucleo32-board-mb1430-stmicroelectronics.pdf) : Contains all information about the board (electrical circuit, solder bridges, pinouts, etc)

[DeepBlueEmbedded](https://deepbluembedded.com) : Lesson and examples for STM32 programming, very well explained and covers all basic topics.
